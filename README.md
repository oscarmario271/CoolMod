# Cool Mod!!!
Cool Mod adds some features to minecraft:

## Friend list
Cool Mod adds a friend list to the game which can be accessed by "/friend add" and "/friend remove". This friend list also has a feature that displays a white column above a friends' head when you are over 48 blocks away from them. This can be toggled in the options menu. It is called the 'Friend Marker'. The friend marker can be entirely configured in the config. Read "Extra Info" to find out how to open the config.

## Teleportation Waypoints
Also known as TP Ways, Teleportation Waypoints can be accessed by "/tpway add", "/tpway remove", and "/tpway tp". You can also remove waypoints in the config. **Use this at your own risk. I am not responsible if you get banned from a server using this feature. There is nothing a server can do to stop you using this feature in the latest update of the mod right now.** In shorter words, only use this feature in _your own_ server.

### Extra info
This mod is **client-side** (does **not** work on servers). To open configs, press 'O' or use `Mod Menu`. To get instant / direct access to this project, talk to me _in person_ if you know me as a friend etc. You will probably have access to this project via that anyway. The latest version of this mod requires **`Fabric API` and `Cloth Config API`** to work. You could also use `Mod Menu` to access the config more easily. The mod's latest version should always be compatible with the latest version of minecraft.
